- Second year Web Programming Coursework

## Coursework Description

This coursework is for the second year Web Programming course. It involves creating a web application that allows users to create and manage their workout plans. The application is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a backend server.

## Additional Features (If More Time Was Available)

If more time was available, the following features could be added to the application:

1. User Authentication: Implement a user authentication system to secure user data and allow for personalized experiences.
2. Workout Statistics: Track and display workout statistics such as total workout time, most frequently used workouts, etc.
3. Workout Reminders: Allow users to set reminders for their workouts.
4. Social Sharing: Enable users to share their workout plans with others on social media platforms.

## How It Works

The application uses a client-server architecture. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It communicates with the backend server using HTTP requests. The backend server is built using a web framework such as Express.js and a database such as MongoDB. It handles the business logic of the application, such as user authentication, workout plan creation, and data storage.
